        Perform an upload of the given file to the current user's account

        The upload process consists of three steps and a loop.
        First, we request and receive an "upload ticket" from Vimeo. This ticket
        represents our place in the queue of videos waiting to upload.
        After successfully obtaining this ticket, we upload the binary data of the
        video. To do this, we make an HTTP request whose body contains some
        amount of the video's binary data. In response to a subsequent request, Vimeo tells us how
        much of the binary data was successfully uploaded. We repeat this process
        until Vimeo tells us the entirety of the file has been uploaded successfully.
        Once the entire video has been uploaded, the last step is to delete the
        upload ticket with another HTTP request. This action finalizes the upload
        process.
